            I’m a Computer Science freshman, a highly-motivated mobile and web developer with an acquired taste for
            elegant design, an <a href=https://github.com/kelvinkamau>open source</a> hobbyist passionate about finding
            and matching underlying patterns within our diverse ideas so that we don’t have to keep reinventing the
            wheel and lastly, a <a href=https://meetup.com/GDG-Kisii/>community</a> mentor keen to inspire
            change-makers.
        </p>

        <p>Being a full-stack engineer, my goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the
            hood while providing engaging, adaptive, eye-candy user experiences. Secondly,community gives me an opportunity to
            share knowledge as much as I want to learn, to bring out the best in me.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably talking at a <a
                href="https://meetup.com/GDG-Kisii" target="_blank">tech meetup</a>, hanging out with
            my bestfriend or giving free therapy to a cool friend.</p>
