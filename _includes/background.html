            I’m a Computer Science freshman, a highly-motivated mobile and web developer with an acquired taste for
            elegant design, an <a href="https://github.com/kelvinkamau" target="_blank">open source</a> hobbyist
            passionate about analyzing and matching underlying patterns within our diverse ideas so that we don’t have
            to keep reinventing the wheel and lastly, a <a href="https://meetup.com/GDG-Kisii/" target="_blank">community</a>
            mentor keen to inspire change-makers.
        </p>

        <p>Being a full-stack engineer, my goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under
            the hood while providing engaging, adaptive, eye-candy user experiences. On the other hand, community gives
            me a platform to share complementary ideas with my peers and accelerate the process of crafting better solutions
            without being distracted by the buzz, glitz and opportunities that seem to exist.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably talking at a <a
                href="https://meetup.com/GDG-Kisii" target="_blank">tech meetup</a>, hanging out with
            my bestfriend or giving free therapy to a cool friend.</p>
